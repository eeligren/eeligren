### Hello You ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eeli GrÃ©n. I am currently working with React, WordPress, and PHP through my studies at Saimaan ammattiopisto Sampo.

I also operate as an entrepreneur in my own company, Fimes @fimesfi, which provides digital marketing services, software development, and much more!

I am also a competitor and a member of the Finnish national skills team on my way to the 2024 WorldSkills competition in my discipline, which is 17 web development.
