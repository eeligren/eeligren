### Hello You ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eeli GrÃ©n, and I come from a small village in South Karelia, Finland, called Taipalsaari. I recently graduated from Saimaan ammattiopisto Sampo as a software developer, and I'm currently working full-time in my own digital marketing and software company, Fimes.

In 2024, I'll be competing in the WorldSkills World Championship in my field, web development. If you want to know more about my journey, you can read about it here.

My Tech Stack in Web Development:
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Backend: Laravel, Python
- Other Tools I Use:
- Docker: For containerizing applications and ensuring consistent development environments.
- Git: For version control and collaborative development.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines: To streamline and automate the testing and deployment processes.

I don't have the energy to write everything here, but if you want to know more about me or my projects, here are a few links:
